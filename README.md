## About Trova

Trova enables users to find points of interest in their local area based on interest they have. These interests are obtained through a quiz that is powered by the BoredAPI. Based on how the user answers this quiz, the feed tab will populate with places relative to those interests. Trova also has a UserFeed for individuals to post their own events. Trova is all about bringing people together, this section is dedicated to just that.


## Things to keep in mind

1] If nothing shows up in the feed you may have forgot to fill out the quiz. Click on the quiz tab and check a few boxes to show your interest in the activity.

2] The 'likes' on the posts are currently randomly generated. This means that if you refresh you may see a post's score change. The score is meant to be a demo of future functionality.

3] The feed items are not currently clickable. Instead, we use this section to quickly show the user places near them that are tailored to their interests.

## Trouble Shooting /  BUGS

Images not showing up on the cards?
    This could be due to a limitation on pixabay's random image API.
